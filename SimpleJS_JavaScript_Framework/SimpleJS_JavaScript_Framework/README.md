# SimpleJS
An upcoming lightweight simple JavaScript framework designed to simplify JavaScript.
We are determined to make JavaScript as easy as possible for developers. It'll also save a lot of time

## Example
`documenet.getElementById("myDiv");` is `doc.getId("myDiv");` in SimpleJS.

## Server Help
To run server.js you first need to get into that directory. This can be done by the bash command: `cd /server/server.js`. Once done, run `node server.js` into the terminal. A https server should start. And **Note to self:** the https server is a TEST server. It's purpose is to test the web socket of the client (main.js). Use it how you like. (Mabye not for malicious acts??)

## Required Packages (If you don't get the ones already installed)
**Node.js** - `npm install node.js`

**ws** - `npm instal ws`
