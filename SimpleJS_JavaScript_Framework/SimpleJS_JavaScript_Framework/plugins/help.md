### How to make a plugin
You can make a plugin by simple creating a JavaScript file, and in the file you must fill out the following:
- AUTHOR
- PURPOSE
- PLUGIN TYPE (Frontend/Backend/GameDev)
- SUMMARY:
- *LINKS: (email, github, discord, etc...)

Once those are fill out, you can now start coding! There are a few ground rule:
1. Your code must have: ```const myPrefix = {}```. You can change "myPrefix" to whatever you like. Remember when someone is writting your code, it will start with myPrefix. Example: ```myPrefix.log("Hello, World!");```. You can either create a JavaScript file or send me it. If you'll like to test your file with HTML, you can do so by adding the following script tag:

```<script src="https://1gfv621i.live.codepad.app/src/main.js"></script>```

There will be an alternate url if the main one goes down. You can also either create the JavaScript file or send me it via `thunderedstudios@gmail.com`. P.S. You can always add your code into ```/src/main.js``` which is the main file. If your code is for **Backend only** you can add it/we'll add it in ```/src/networking/network.js```. If it's **Frontend only** it will go in ```/src/main.js```. If it **Game Development (WebGL)** it will go in ```/src/gameDev/webgl.js```

Instrustion with the * behind it means it is not `required` to be done.
